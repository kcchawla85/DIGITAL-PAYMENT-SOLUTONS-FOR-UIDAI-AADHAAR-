# DIGITAL-PAYMENT-SOLUTONS-FOR-UIDAI-AADHAAR-
This project is a digital payment based solution that is designed to ensure that there is no scope of overcharging  by the operators at the UIDAI centers. The solution collect the amount from the operator in a digital manner  and transfer the amount to the Registrar/EA/Operatorâ€™s account at the end of the day. We have designed this  project in such a manner that it is leading to DIGITAL INDIA VISION. There are many enrollment centers  across India for residents to enroll and update. In these enrolment centers people complaint of overcharging by  the operators for the services. We are developing a one stop platform where user can easily register themselves  and make payments that are nominal as per fixed by UIDAI. Whenever anyone will visit the official UIDAI  page we will give them option for what purpose they are enrolling like name update, contact update and  address update, etc. We will give them the payment gateway and we will add all the payment methods that are  possible for the convenience. We will give them receipt and tokens in which we will provide them time and  date for their schedule availability for the enrolment. We will also develop a plan to transfer all the money  collected to the registrar/EA/Operator's account at the possible intervals. We will be maintaining safe records  of the payments through our databases.
